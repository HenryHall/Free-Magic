# Free Magic


##What is Free Magic?

  Free Magic is a tool I created to draft Magic: The Gathering cards over the internet.  Using Socket.io to connect users, anywhere from 1-10 players can play a simulated Magic draft together.  [What is a booster draft?](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/lo/basics-booster-draft-2014-11-03)

##Why isn't Free Magic live?

  I am not currently hosting Free Magic anywhere because of potential IP infringment.  This application was a project for school and is not indented for any other use.
  
##How does it work?

  Using a JSON from MTGJSON.com I am able to use information to search Wizard of the Coast's Gatherer database for specific cards.  Once the packs of cards are randomized on my server, I am able to pull images from Gatherer.
